- Always use kebab-case for new files.
- Classes that extends ValueObject, Entity or Aggregate must have private constructor and static factory method "create",
a static schema for validate create factory method props and a static method "isValidProps" that checks if given props is valid using the schema
- Methods and functions must return Result<ReturnTypeSuccess, Error> from "@inpro-labs/core", Use Err(new Error("message")) for error, Ok(returnData) for success. Both comes from "@inpro-labs/core"
